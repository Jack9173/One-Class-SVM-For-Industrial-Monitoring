# One-Class-SVM-For-Industrial-Monitoring

This project demonstrates the implementation of a One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm for real-time anomaly detection in industrial processes. It focuses on identifying abnormal temperature readings, potentially indicating equipment malfunctions or process deviations.

#Functionality:

Trains a One-Class SVM model on a sample dataset of temperature readings.
Defines a function detect_anomaly to classify new temperature data points as normal or anomalous based on the trained model.
Provides basic feedback on whether a new data point is considered an anomaly.

#Requirements:
Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
scikit-learn library (pip install scikit-learn)
numpy library (pip install numpy)
Usage:

#Clone or Download: Obtain the project from GitHub.
Run the Script: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Execute:

#Bash
python one_class_svm_industrial_monitoring.py

#Further Exploration:
Research different anomaly detection algorithms for potential improvements.
Explore advanced optimization techniques for the One-Class SVM model.
Visualize temperature data and anomaly scores to gain deeper insights.
